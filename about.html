<p>Hi, my name's Alex. I'm a passionate Android developer and a huge fan of design patterns.</p>

<p>As a contributor to several open-source projects and an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/844882/alex-lockwood">active user</a> on StackOverflow, I've encountered too many applications that suffer due to poor code design. Organizing the code that makes up your Android project can be a challenge, but it is essential when writing an application that can be easily extended and maintained in the future.</p>

<p>The goal of this blog is simple: to encourage proper coding practices when it comes to Android development. The blog posts range from in-depth tutorials to casual rants on Android-related topics. I hope that each post will give you with a better understanding as to why proper code design in Android development is so important.</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to ask me questions in the comments! I usually respond within a few hours and the additional clarification benefits everyone. You can <a href="http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/p/contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any suggestions about the site (responding to emails about the site is one of my top priorities). Feel free to add me on <a href="https://plus.google.com/100751609891157863386/" rel="me">Google+</a> as well!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Alex</p>
