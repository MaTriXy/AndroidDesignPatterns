This post focuses on shared element transitions. This is the second of a series of posts I will be writing about Activity Transitions:

* **Part 1:** <a href="/2014/11/activity-transitions-getting-started-part1.html">Getting Started with Activity Transitions</a>
* **Part 2:** Window Content Transitions In-Depth (_coming soon!_)
* **Part 3:** Shared Element Transitions In-Depth (_coming soon!_)

Note that although Activity Transitions will be the primary focus of these posts, much of the information also applies to Fragment Transitions as well. For those of you who are working with the Fragment Transition APIs, don't fret: I'll point out the significant differences between the two as they are encountered in the post!

**TODO: write sentence transitioning into next section...**
