### Creating Advanced Transitions Using `SharedElementCallback`s

You can further customize your shared element transitions by setting a [`SharedElementCallback`][SharedElementCallback]. Understanding the SharedElementCallback class will be important if you want to implement custom Transitions that are more complicated than simply moving an image from one location to another. In particular, the following three callback methods are very important to understand when writing more complex shared element transitions:

* `onMapSharedElements()` lets you adjust the mapping of shared element names to Views. **TODO: more detail.**
* `onSharedElementStart()` and `onSharedElementEnd()` let you adjust view properties in your layout immediately before the transitions capture their start and end values respectively. **TODO: more detail.**
