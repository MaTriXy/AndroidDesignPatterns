<div class='post'>
<p>This (rather short) post introduces the concept of a <b>utility class</b>&nbsp;and gives a simple example of how you can use one to tidy up your code. As Android projects grow in size, it becomes increasingly important that your code remains organized and well-structured. Providing a utility class for commonly called methods can help tremendously in reducing the complexity of your project, allowing you to structure your code in a readable and easily understandable way.</p> <p>Here's a simple example. Let's say you are building an Android application that frequently checks the device's SDK version code, to ensure backward&nbsp;compatibility. You'll need to use the constants provided in the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES</span> class, but these constants are long and can quickly clutter up your code. In this case, it might be a good idea to create a <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">CompatabilityUtil</span> utility class. A sample implementation is given below:</p> <a name='more'></a> <p><pre class="brush: java"><br />public class CompatibilityUtil {<br />    <br />  /**<br />   * Get the current Android API level.<br />   */<br />  public static int getSdkVersion() {<br />    return Build.VERSION.SDK_INT;<br />  }<br /><br />  /**<br />   * Determine if the device is running API level 8 or higher.<br />   */<br />  public static boolean isFroyo() {<br />    return getSdkVersion() >= Build.VERSION_CODES.FROYO;<br />  }<br /><br />  /**<br />   * Determine if the device is running API level 11 or higher.<br />   */<br />  public static boolean isHoneycomb() {<br />    return getSdkVersion() >= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB;<br />  }<br /><br />  /**<br />   * Determine if the device is a tablet (i.e. it has a large screen).<br />   * <br />   * @param context The calling context.<br />   */<br />  public static boolean isTablet(Context context) {<br />    return (context.getResources().getConfiguration().screenLayout<br />            & Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_MASK)<br />            >= Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_LARGE;<br />  }<br /><br />  /**<br />   * Determine if the device is a HoneyComb tablet.<br />   * <br />   * @param context The calling context.<br />   */<br />  public static boolean isHoneycombTablet(Context context) {<br />    return isHoneycomb() && isTablet(context);<br />  }<br /><br />  /**<br />   * This class can't be instantiated.<br />   */<br />  private CompatibilityUtil() { }<br />}<br /></pre></p> <p>Developers often create a separate package called <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">[package name].util</span> for frequently used utility classes. So for example, if your package name is <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">com.example.myapp</span>, then a nice place to put your utility classes would be in a separate package called <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">com.example.myapp.util</span>. However, remember that there's no need to&nbsp;<i>over-organize</i>&nbsp;your project. Creating a separate package might be a good idea for a larger project, but is completely unnecessary if your project contains only 5-10 classes. I might write a post about package/class organization in the future. For now, check out the (very well-designed) <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iosched/source/browse/">Google I/O 2011</a> app's source code. You will learn a lot!</p></div>

This is probably a really dumb question, but where do you put the class and how do you actually create it (absolutely android beginner here :)). I&#39;m following a tutorial that says &quot;create a utility class&quot; and have been trying to figure out how to do that to no avail.</div>
