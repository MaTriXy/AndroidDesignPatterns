title: Why Ice Cream Sandwich Crashes Your App

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class='post'>
<p>The following question has plagued StackOverflow ever since Ice Cream Sandwich's initial release:</p> <p><blockquote>My application works fine on devices running Android 2.x, but force closes on devices running HoneyComb (3.x) and Ice Cream Sandwich (4.x). Why does this occur? </blockquote></p> <p>This is a great question; after all, newer versions of Android are released with the expectation that old apps will remain compatible with new devices. In my experience, there are a couple reasons why this might occur. Most of the time, however, the reason is simple: <i>you are performing a potentially expensive operation on the UI thread.</i></p> <h4>What is the UI Thread?</h4> <p>The concept and importance of the  application's <b>main UI thread</b> is something every Android developer should understand. Each time an application is launched, the system creates a thread called "main" for the application. The main thread (also known as the "UI thread") is in charge of dispatching events to the appropriate views/widgets and thus is very important. It's also the thread where your application interacts with running components of your application's UI. For instance, if you touch a button on the screen, the UI thread dispatches the touch event to the view, which then sets its pressed state and posts an invalidate request to the event queue. The UI thread dequeues this request and then tells the view to redraw itself.</p> <p>This single-thread model can yield poor performance unless Android applications are implemented properly. Specifically, if the UI thread was in charge of running everything in your entire application, performing long operations such as network access or database queries on the UI thread would block the entire user interface. No event would be able to be dispatched—including drawing and touchscreen events—while the long operation is underway. From the user's perspective, the application will appear to be frozen.</p><a name='more'></a> <p>In these situations, instant feedback is vital. Studies show that <b>0.1 seconds</b> is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously. Anything slower than this limit will probably be considered as <b>lag</b> (<a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html">Miller 1968; Card et al. 1991</a>). While a fraction of a second might not seem harmful, even a tenth of a second can be the difference between a good review and a bad review on the Android Market. Even worse, if the UI thread is blocked for more than about five seconds, the user is presented with the notorious "application not responding" (ANR) dialog and the app is force closed.</p> <h4>Why Android Crashes Your App</h4> <p>The reason why your application crashes on Android versions 3.0 and above, but works fine on Android 2.x is because <b>HoneyComb and Ice Cream Sandwich are much stricter about abuse against the UI Thread</b>. For example, when an Android device running HoneyComb or above detects a network access on the UI thread, a <code>NetworkOnMainThreadException</code> will be thrown:</p> <p><pre class="brush: plain"><br />E/AndroidRuntime(673): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity<br />ComponentInfo{com.example/com.example.ExampleActivity}: android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException<br /></pre></p> <p>The explanation as to why this occurs is well documented on the Android developer's site:</p> <p><blockquote>A <code>NetworkOnMainThreadException</code> is thrown when an application attempts to perform a networking operation on its main thread. This is only thrown for applications targeting the Honeycomb SDK or higher. Applications targeting earlier SDK versions are allowed to do networking on their main event loop threads, but it's heavily discouraged. </blockquote></p> <p>Some examples of other operations that ICS and HoneyComb <i>won't</i> allow you to perform on the UI thread are:</p> <ul><li>Opening a <code>Socket</code> connection (i.e. <code>new Socket()</code>).</li><li>HTTP requests (i.e. <code>HTTPClient</code> and <code>HTTPUrlConnection</code>).</li><li>Attempting to connect to a remote MySQL database.</li><li>Downloading a file (i.e. <code>Downloader.downloadFile()</code>).</li></ul> <p>If you are attempting to perform any of these operations on the UI thread, you <i>must</i> wrap them in a worker thread. The easiest way to do this is to use of an <code>AsyncTask</code>, which allows you to perform asynchronous work on your user interface. An <code>AsyncTask</code> will perform the blocking operations in a worker thread and will publish the results on the UI thread, without requiring you to handle threads and/or handlers yourself.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>The reason why I decided to write about this topic is because I have seen it come up on StackOverflow and other forums countless times. The majority of the time the error stems from placing expensive operations directly on the UI thread. To ensure you don't disrupt the user experience, it is very important to execute Socket connections, HTTP requests, file downloads, and other long-term operations on a separate Thread. The easiest way to do this is to wrap your operation in an AsyncTask, which launches a new thread and allows you to perform asynchronous work on your user interface.</p> <p>As always, let me know if this was helpful by +1-ing the post or leaving a comment below! Feel free to ask questions too... I respond to them quickly. :)</p> <h4>Helpful Links</h4> <p>Here are some helpful links that might help you get started with <code>AsyncTask</code>s.</p> <ul><li><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html"><code>AsyncTask</code></a> documentation</li><li><a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/07/multithreading-for-performance.html">Multithreading For Performance</a></li></ul></div>

AsyncTask will always be relevant in Android. All an AsyncTask really is under-the-hood is a bunch of threads (more specifically, a multi-threaded ExecutorService). The only difference is that AsyncTask provides a few callback methods (onPreExecute(), onPostExecute(), etc.) that make it easy to synchronize with the main thread and make it more difficult for developers not as familiar with Java to accidentally introduce race conditions in their code. The person on StackOverflow is correct in that using AsyncTask is not necessary (you could just create your own threads instead)... but he is incorrect in saying that it is &quot;outdated&quot; or &quot;shouldn&#39;t be used&quot;... that just isn&#39;t true. :)</div>

Thank you for a great post, simple and clear (and still usefull, even if it is more than 1 year old). Solved my problem AND made me aware of an important design issue!<br />Just wondering if AsyncTask is still the best way to go nowadays (Android 4.4 about to get out), as I&#39;ve read a few comments on stackoverflow against its use (and telling to use Thread/Runnable instead). I&#39;ll post here if I find an answer to that.</div>

No, don&#39;t do that, you&#39;re just masking the problem! Make sure all long-running requests are performed on a background thread instead!</div>

I posted it on Stack Overflow and I am posting the link here too. Please take a look at it. Let me know if I am going wrong somewhere. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13796306/multiple-image-upload-using-asynctask-in-android-using-phonegap</div>

Sounds like a problem with how you are performing the network request... not a problem with how you are using the AsyncTask. Post a question on StackOverflow with the code you are using and you&#39;ll probably get a response pretty quick... if not, you can post a link to the post here and I can take a look. :)</div>

Removing <i>targetSdkVersion</i> most likely won&#39;t have any effect if your <i>minSdkVersion</i> is greater than or equal to &quot;11&quot;... I wouldn&#39;t think of it as a &quot;quick solution&quot;. :)</div>

Agreed..<br />I also had the same issue, &quot;NetworkOnMainThreadException&quot;<br /><br />I could resolve it by removing targetSDKVersion=15 attribute from manifest.<br /><br />It may be due to some compatibility modes.<br />It was ok as a quick solution, but you MUST use a different thread when it comes to time consuming tasks like network operations.</div>
