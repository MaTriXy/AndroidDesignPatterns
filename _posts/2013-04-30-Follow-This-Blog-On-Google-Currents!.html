<p>Hi all,<p/> <p>I've recently made this blog available on Google Currents! Install the application and subscribe by clicking the link below:</p> <p><b><a href="https://www.google.com/producer/editions/CAow5Ir3AQ/android_design_patterns">Follow this blog on Google Currents!</a></b></p> <p>If you have never used Google Currents, I strongly recommend that you try it out. It's a really great way to keep up with the latest news, blogs, and your favorite Google+ streams, and it works seamlessly offline (which I've found is great for long plane rides). If you're a long time Flipboard user, I recommend you give it a try as well... in my opinion, Currents is easier to navigate and feels much more like a native Android application. That said, I do tend to be a bit biased towards the native Google apps. :P</p> <p>As always, don't hesitate to leave a comment if you find a bug or have any suggestions on how I can improve the edition! I'm going to try really hard to keep it up-to-date for those of you who follow this blog and can't get enough of Google Currents!</p> <p>Cheers,<br>Alex</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androiddesignpatterns/~4/2d1YpTZDVzM" height="1" width="1"/>
